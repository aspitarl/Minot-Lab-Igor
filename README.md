# Minot-Lab-OSU

Collection of code and data analysis from my PhD work in the Minot Lab as OSU. 


Data analysis done in igor pro. It creates a control panel in igor pro functions that can pull in and analysse I-V curves, spectral data, images, etc. 

Note: this is mostly just an archive of old code and much of it has not been updated or tested
